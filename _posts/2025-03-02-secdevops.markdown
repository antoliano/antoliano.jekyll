# Adding Images to Your Posts

You can easily add images to your Jekyll posts. Here's how:

## Method 1: Relative Path

Store your images in the `assets` or `images` folder and reference them like this:

![My Image](/assets/my-image.jpg)

## Method 2: External URL

You can also use images hosted online:

![External Image](https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
